# Overview
This is my solution for a Frontend Mentor challenge.  
The web page displays a comparison of three car rental options: **Sedans**, **SUVs**, and **Luxury**. Each section highlights the features of the car type, includes an icon, a descriptive paragraph, and a "Learn More" button.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open `challenge1.html` in your browser.

## Notes

- The challenge was based on a design from Frontend Mentor.
- I focused on matching the layout and style as closely as possible to the given design.
- No JavaScript was used, keeping the solution simple and focused on layout and styling.
- The footer credits Frontend Mentor and the original coder.
